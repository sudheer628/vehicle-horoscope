    "1": "A car with 01 as a number is the leader on the road. It accelerates quickly, is reliable and attracts attention. It is very favourable for business people.",
    "2": "Such a car is reliable and rarely breaks down and is a very promising number. Such cars rarely get stolen or stopped by traffic cops. A vehicle with the energy of two is a real fortress on wheels.",
    "3": "The number 3 is a somewhat inconsistent number on a car. On the upside, though, the number brings good luck for some, especially those whose professions are related to money.",
    "4": "Well, this car is not designed for fast driving on the road. The car is not for business people, but great for creative people. It rarely has a serious break down. ",
    "5": "The number five promotes unreasonable rearrangements and resourcefulness on the road, but gets along well with other travellers on the way and rarely has accidents.",
    "6": "A combination of 6 with other even numbers is the best option for the most expensive cars as it will give service for a long time and will not fail.",
    "7": "A car with a registration number that translates into the number seven does not attract attention in the stream. It rarely breaks down, but the car body is very susceptible to corrosion.",
    "8": "Eight is a reliable car for quiet riders. It is not able to show character, but rarely breaks down. A car with such a number plate is efficient and a good choice for commuting. ",
    "9": "The last in the row is number 9. A car with this number is an impulsive machine that loves to “drive.” This number means you take quick decisions, but may also drive too fast. It does not tolerate obstructions and does not let other traffic overtake it on the road."
